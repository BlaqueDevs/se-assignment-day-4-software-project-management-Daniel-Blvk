# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
1. timely delivery is essential in project management because:
       -> it reduces the risk of going over budget
       -> it reduces the risk of going overtime and time wastage in developing software.
       -> it makes the debigging process cheaper since debugging snd testing should be done during development period
       -> it makes stakeholders satisfied in seeing the work complete and running.
2. how project managers ensure deadlines are met
       -> planning accordingly to the development process ie. every step shouldhavea timeframe
       -> having follow up meetings with the development team to see the progress made.
       -> organizing the tasks by utilizing tools like jira to visualize the project timeline of development
       -> assisting in making sure all tasks are complete within set timeframes and overtimes being considered.

   
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
1. effective cost control contributes to the success of the software project by:
       -> BY having budget management strategies to allocate funds to respective modules and processes reducing waste.
       -> BY making sure that the project timeline is met since going overtime means going overbudget.
       -> BY avoiding wastage of a budget by purchasing required tools and assets important to the project in question.
2. strategies to be used to prevent budget overruns.
       -> have a clear set budget with clear set module goals and allocations
       -> have an expenditure plan to know how to implement budgets in a clear manner
       -> have a clear deadline to prevent overspending on extra time and person months.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
waterfall methodologies vs agile methodologies
waterfall methidologies uses a step by step apporoach in system development while agilemethodologies use dynamic ways of software developments with changing requirements.
advatages of waterfall methodologies
1. allows the developer to complete one process in development cycle then enter the next phase of development reducing confusion .
2. suitable for systems with no changing requirements.
3. has a clear structure of implementation (SDLC)
4. enables focusing on a clear goal without deflecting unlike agile which may focus in the end goal while upgrading the system.
disadvantages of waterfall methodologies
1. making changes in the software is hard since every step has a timeline.
2. development focuses on the develoment team together with the solid requirements minus the user
3. reduces user experience and user contribution such that the end product might not meet changing user requirements
4. expensive when doing testing at the end of development.
advantages of agile methodologies
1. easy to make changes to software code during development
2. cheap in implementing testing since testing is done early in the developmet stages until completion
3. more edged on user experience and interaction since the develpopers include the user in the developmet process
4. since the developmet process changes with new requirements, the end product is quality software.
disadvntages of agile methodologies
1. highly dependent on the user. this might cause unavoidable inconveniences during development
2. inadequate team collaboration can lead to project delay and stagnation
3. planning and implementation can take alot of time especially with small projects and small teams.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
for agile methodologies:
1. web applications are best suited for agile methodologies since content changes and user requirements eg UI/UX design might be suggested by ways of commentaries or surveys.
    for example: university taxi booking platform, university online clothes shop.
for waterfall methodologies:
1.for websites( static websites) with no changing information is best suited. for example:
    online research paper viewing system for researchers and studentd.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
methods for ensuring software quality.
1. involving the user or stakeholders in the development process.
2. testing after each deliverable being developed to remove bugs present in the system
3. having user experience testing by rolling out the system to selected users to get feedback on areasto improve.
4. testing for requirement delivery from the system according to user requirements specification.
5. reducing runtime when actions are done in order to assist in efficiency.
6. developing heavily on eror handling and exception handling in order to handle invalid user inputs.

importance of maintaining high standards
1. makes software worthy of use
2. makes the software reliable 
3. solves problems for users and stakeholders alike
4. quality software is worth an investment
5. quality software is easy for new users to interact with since it is user friendly

   
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
defining software scope contributes to successful project planning in the following ways.
1. with a scope, developers get to know which user requirements to consider hence stay within the timeline and schedule
2. with a clear scope, the project amnager knows which asseststo buy to satisfy the user or stakeholder requirements.
3. with a clear scope, the project will not have extra features that are not required hence having short development time and proper budget use.

a work breakdown structure is a formula so to say that assists in dividing large projects into smaller achievable milestones and allocating time and teams to them.
a WBS useful because:
1. it helps the developers do sprints of development by accomplishing strategic goals on time.
2. it assists in meeting project deadline becausse the divided sprints are achievable since each team works on one module to completion.
3. helps to minitor incomplete projects, and keep track of finished modules and those with pending allocations

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
benefits of developing a detailed project schedule include:
1. project schedules help in saving time on development
2. they help in scraping out deadweight of unimportant tesks and procedures and focusing on the goal of develoment and it's processes.
3. project schedules help in allocacion of funds and bidgets when needed.
4. they help on saving money by making sure the project does not exceed the appointed deadline
5. they make the stakeholders and customers happy by delivering on time and in completion.
-> gantt charts help in marking out the proceccs within the project with their respective timelines and deliverables.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
1. my software seeks to remove the barrier between freight drivers and everyday regular customers who seek services of transportation and relocation.
2. my software seeks to bring customers closer even though a distance away, through technology by heloung customers of different areas, seek and finfd freight drivers from within their vicinity and find specifications that they need for thwir service.
3. remove middlemen who might take advantage of customers and lead them to low service providing drivers.
-> these problems are faced by froeight drivers and controlers since there is no difinitive way to reach customers or for customers to reach the drivers except by phone which might be hard since some drivers have on  type of vehicle and customers might not want the size being offered so the customer has to see for themselves the lorry size and photos before employing a driver for the sevice.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
defining clear problem helps by:
1. a known problem seeks a solution. without a problem solutions cannot be found.
2. defining a problem showcases the effects of the problem to real world users and now how to make sure the problem removes the everyday struggle to get by with the problem.
3. defining a problem well, seeks out a question of what are the methods present that seek to solve the problem and how effective are they in solving the problem. then after this amore efficient and effective solution can be offered.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
think of finding a truck driver, a driver within your vicinity, adriver with a rofile page with details of the vehicle of your choice, you need a pickup truck? mini lorry, mid-sized lorry, trailler or a flatbed? check out transnet.com and find services offered by truck drivers around you. no nned to make long phone calls to find out whether the driver is available or not, chech the status and confirm if the service is ready to be offered or not. Transnet, services at your finger tips.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
1. a geographical scanner with details of the driver's trucks and their respective venues for customers who logged into the system.
2. truck tracker that shows where the truck is during service delivery.
3. user friendly interface with clear instructions to help users and drivers alike to access their profiles and messages.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
the freight business space is massive not only within my vicinity but country wide. ports need trailers to transport cargo, my software alerts them of trucks within the vicinity with specification they might be intereted in.
-> this software can be adopted in any region within the cointry and also any region outside the country.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
-> knowing what the market needs will help in developing software that offers or points out the solution to everyday users.
-> knowing the size of the market means knowing the range of users expected to register with the software leading to knowing the best practices to store data and size of servers to have in order to assist in handling crashes when an overload occurs.
-> with changing customer demands having advertisments that fit a number of drivers is essential in finding a market fro them to flourish
