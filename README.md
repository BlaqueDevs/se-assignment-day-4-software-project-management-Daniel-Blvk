1. timely delivery is essential in project management because:
       -> it reduces the risk of going over budget
       -> it reduces the risk of going overtime and time wastage in developing software.
       -> it makes the debigging process cheaper since debugging snd testing should be done during development period
       -> it makes stakeholders satisfied in seeing the work complete and running.
2. how project managers ensure deadlines are met
       -> planning accordingly to the development process ie. every step shouldhavea timeframe
       -> having follow up meetings with the development team to see the progress made.
       -> organizing the tasks by utilizing tools like jira to visualize the project timeline of development
       -> assisting in making sure all tasks are complete within set timeframes and overtimes being considered.
